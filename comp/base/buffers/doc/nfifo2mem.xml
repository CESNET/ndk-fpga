	<!-- THE MOST IMPORTANT PART!!! There should be about 8 rows which
	     fully describe the component and its main functions -->

	The component receives data from multiple interfaces via sh_fifo
  (FIFO from shift registers - one for each flow)	and stores them into memory
  (BRAM - dp_bmem or LUT - dp_distmem - wrapped in buf_mem). On read interface
  data is accessed as	in common memory - by address - and can be read several
  times. DATA_VLD signal marks valid data from memory, user of component is
  responsible for giving right RD_ADDR (reading from non-occupied memory blocks
  is possible, also memory collisions can occur as a result of bad addressing).
  Releasing of used space is done by rel_len signal (when rel_len_dv for
  appropriate block is set) which says how many items (of DATA_WIDTH) should
  be released.

<!-- HW BODY SECTION **************************************************** -->
<!-- information for HW designers, structure should be as follow          -->

<h1>NFIFO2MEM info</h1>

	<p>
    Equation DATA_WIDTH mod FLOWS = 0 is asserted (DATA_WIDTH/FLOWS is input
    width of single generic interface, all of them are joined into a vector).
    At each input flow data are received to sh_fifo and then send to memory
    using a switching logic (rx_switch). Reading is done by giving a number
    of input flow, where data were received (BLOCK_ADDR), and an offset in
    block's memory space (RD_ADDR starting at 0). Empty signal becomes inactive
    after a whole item (of DATA_WIDTH, i.e. FLOWS items were received on input)
    is available (affected by GLOB_STATE).
    Read latency is 1 CLK cycle for BRAM and 0 for LUT - if OUTPUT_REG = true
    than register is put into the path and latency is 1 cycle greater.
    Releasing memory space takes 2 CLK cycles and can cause problems when
    rel_len is 0 with rel_len_dv set!
    When FLOWS is set to 1, no switching is done.
	</p>

<h1>Schemes</h1>

	<p>
		The block structure of the component is in the following figure.
		It's composed of memory (dp_distmem or dp_bmem without output register
    wrapped in buf_mem), input sh_fifos (FIFOs from shift registers), control
    logic (buf_status) and switching logic (rx_switch).
