Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
These transmit buffers receive data of full width with number of interface,
where it should be later sent. Writing is done either as into memory
(by address and later newlen signal) or as into fifo (just write signal).
BRAM or LUT memory can be used. Switching is done inside the component
and output is send to sh_fifos (each of DATA_WIDTH/FLOWS width).
Two kinds of status logic are available (can stop writing even if there
is some space in sh_fifos - uses only memory).

The main usage is in TX DMA buffer (mem version).

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
These receive buffers receive data on generic number of interfaces into
sh_fifos and then switch them into memory (BRAM or LUT). Data can be then
accessed either as from memory (by address and rellen for releasing data) or
as from fifo (just read signal). Output register can be used on memory output,
this increments reading latency by one cycle. Read signal is also used as
pipeline enable signal to memory.
Two kinds of status logic are available (can stop writing even if there
is some space in sh_fifos - uses only memory).

The main usage is in RX DMA buffer (mem version) and fl_binder (fifo version).

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
Behaves as N fifos with common input/output interface. Write signal is decoded
by wr_blk_addr and read signal by rd_blk_addr. Buf_mem is used for storing data,
therefore BRAM or LUT can be used and output register can also be put on output
(increases read latency by one cycle). Read signal is also used as pipeline enable
to memory.

Created for packet DMA controllers.
