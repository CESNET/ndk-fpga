<!-- Short Block description -->
<description>
    Identification component is a small component which is used to detect
    design inside FPGA. It contains project identification, design version,
    version of SW interface, string identification and number of RX and TX
    channels. Also there is Command register which controls COMMAND output
    of the component, bit 0 is usually used for SW resetting. 128-bit Status
    register may be written from hardware and read by software. Informations
    are stored inside registers which are accessible through universal 32 bit
    interface.

        <p>
            Sometimes it is useful to have a way how to know if the
            identification component is presented in the design or not. So,
            the NEG register has been add at address 0 to ID component. If
            you write a value to the NEG register, the logic negation of
            the number is stored and can be also read. ID component should
            be placed to address 0 of FPGA address space. So, the NEG
            register should be also at address 0 of the whole FPGA address
            space.

    <h1>Identification component</h1>

    <p>
        ID component consists of several registers which are maped to the
        FPGA address space and can be simple read.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first 32bit word is writable and is dedicated to detect if
        ID component is presented. If you write there any value, the
        negative value is stored.  Following 32bit register contain
        unique project number and software major and minor version number.
        Next two registers contain hardware major and minor
        version number.
        Next register is Command register and may be used to controll
        dedicated COMMAND output of the component.
        Status register is writable from hardware in four 32-bit words.
        This way, hardware can pass information about its state to software.
        The next 32 words is string for better project
        identification.
        Last readable register contains number of RX channels in lowest byte
        and number of TX channels in next byte.
    </p>

    <p>
        Only the first ID detection and Command register are writable.
        Other registers are read only.
    </p>

    <h2>Interface</h2>

    <p>
        Memory interface is universal type t_mi32.
        In that case, two lowest bits are ignored and five following bits
        are used for addressing.
    </p>

    <h2>Resources</h2>
    <p>
      After synthesis with XST, 197 Slices are used.
      Maximum frequency is much higher than 125MHz.
    </p>
