<description>
   This component is passive probe of arbitrary number of Frame Link
   interfaces. It counts number
   of passed frames and optionally checks
   interfaces for violations of protocol specification.
   Gathered informations are accesible via MI32 interface.

   <h1>Component control</h1>
    <p>
      There is one Control register. By writing zero into it, counting
      is stopped, writing one enables counting again. Counters are not
      cleared. Overflow of counters is not detected.
    </p>
    <h1>Address space</h1>
    <p>
      As properties of this component are affected by several generic
      parameters, also address space is not fixed.
      <ul>
         <li>
            First and second words are always the same, as described in Addr space section.
         </li>
         <li>
            Just after them, there is a set of frame counters.
            One counter occupies as many 32 bit words, as it needs.
            The rest of bits in each word (if CNTR_WIDTH mod 32 != 0)
            is padded with zeros.
            Number of the counters is defined by generic parameter INTERFACES.
            <ul>
            <li>
            If CNTR_WIDTH is lower or equal 32,
            then one counter corresponds to one 32 bit word. The first counter
            is at address 0x08, the second one is at 0x0C, ...
            </li><li>
            If CNTR_WIDTH is greater than 32, but not greater than 64,
            then one counter corresponds to two 32 bit words.
            The first counter is at addresses 0x08 and 0x0C, the second one
            is at 0x10 and 0x14.
            Lower bits of the counter are at lower address.
            </li><li>
            ...
            </li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>
            Just after the highest word of the last frame counter,
            a set of invalid frames counters is placed. These counters are similar
            to frame counters.
         </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Specification</h1>
    <p>
      Each Frame Link interface signal is pipelined in PIPELINE_LEN number
      of registers.
      After that, counters of EOF_N = 0 cycles are used for each interface
      to count number of frames.
    </p>
    <h2>Guard function</h2>
    <p>
      There is also one counter for each interface to detect invalid
      frames. Detection circuit detects frames with incorrect number of
      parts as well as some other errors (eg. SOF without SOP). If Frame Link
      protocol specification is violated, it can be difficult to detect
      frame start and end, so that number of invalid frames may not be exact.
    </p>
    <h3>Detected errors</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>
         SOF must come immediately after EOF. (With respect to RDY signals)
      </li><li>
         SOP must come immediately after EOP. (With respect to RDY signals)
      </li><li>
         With every SOF, SOP must also come.
      </li><li>
         With every EOF, EOP must also come.
      </li><li>
         Number of frame parts must be correct.
      </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
