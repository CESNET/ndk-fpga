                               FrameLink Binder
                              ==================

Abstract:
~~~~~~~~~
Binder simply binds variable count of input FrameLink interface to one output
FrameLink interface. Input and output width/count can be specified by user.
User can also optionaly choose from several input queue choosing algorithms.

This component could prove very useful, when there are components with high
throughput and lesser throughput in our design. We can use FrameLink Splitter
to split data flow from one high-thtoughput component to several instances
of low-throughput components and then use FrameLink Binder to bind the data
flows into one. This approach should improve the maximal throughput of our
design.
