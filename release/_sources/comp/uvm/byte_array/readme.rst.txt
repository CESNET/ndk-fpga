Byte Array agent
****************

The main task of this agent is to generate field of bytes which can be sent to DUT through the lower level agent. This agents does not contains a driver because it is higher level agent.
Agent is used for connecting of all components (driver, monitor,...). Agent has his own configuration object which contains one parameter active (when is up then agent is active in other way is passive).
When agent is active then sequencer is created. When is passive then only monitor is created.

Byte Array sequence item
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sequence item contains only one randomizable item.

- ``byte unsigned data[]`` sequence_item randomizable variable


- ``do_copy`` is used for copying of the transaction.
- ``do_compare`` is used for comparing data of two transactions.
- ``convert2string`` is used for printing whole transaction.



Byte Array monitor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Byte Array monitor is base class used for monitoring of traffic.
This is only simple monitor which creates analysis port and sequence item
and must be subclassed to particular lower level interface.

    See the byte_array_mfb environment for example of Byte Array to MFB conversion.

Byte Array Sequence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This package contains some interesting predefined sequences. Sequences generate N random transactions.
The number of transactions is randomly selected when the sequence is randomized. Transactions contain a randomizable
byte array. The major difference between the sequences is the boundary of the randomized size of a byte array.
Every sequence has its setting which set a boundary for randomization. The following table shows
a simplified description of those sequences. The description describes properties of byte array in transactions.


==========================           ======================================================
Sequence                             Description
==========================           ======================================================
sequence_simple                      size of byte array is randomly distributed by uniform distribution
sequence_simple_const                size of byte array is same for all transactions in sequence
sequence_simple_gauss                size of byte array is randomly distributed by normal distribution
sequence_simple_inc                  size of byte array is increasing in every generated transactions
sequence_simple_dec                  size of byte array is decreasing in every generated transactions
==========================           ======================================================


The last sequence is ``sequence_lib``, which picks N random sequences from the list above
and run consecutively run then on sequencer


Sequence configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Configuration object `config_sequence` contain one configuration function.

=========================  =======  ===================================
Function                   Type     Description
=========================  =======  ===================================
array_size_set(min, max)   [bytes]  Set minimum and maximum array size.
=========================  =======  ===================================

.. code-block:: systemverilog

    sequence_lib seq;

    seq = sequence_lib::type_id::create("seq");
    seq.cfg = new();
    //set maximum and minimum packet size
    seq.cfg.array_size_set(64, 128);
