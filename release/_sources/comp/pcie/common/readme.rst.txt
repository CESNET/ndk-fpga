PCI_EXT_CAP
------------

PCI Extended Capability unit stores OFM-specific identification mechanisms.
It is typically connected to the PCIe core and mapped to the PCI configuration space
as a Vendor-Specific Extension Capability (VSEC) with ID 0x0D7B.

Device Tree
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Device Tree with the firmware description is obtained through the `dtb_pkg` VHDL package.

Software gets the length of stored DT in bytes by reading the `DTB length` register
and then performs the appropriate number of reads from the dword-sized `DTB data` register.
Each read is preceded with a write of the requested dword index to the `DTB address` register.

Device Tree is typically stored in the form of Device Tree Blob (`dtb`) compressed by the `xz`.

Endpoint ID
~~~~~~~~~~~

For multi-PCIe endpoint firmware, the software must identify a particular PCIe endpoint.
For that purpose, it reads the `Endpoint ID` value (4b) in the `Flags` register.
The `Endpoint ID` is valid only if the `Endpoint ID flag` bit is set.

Extra space
~~~~~~~~~~~

The `Extra data` register uses indirect addressing like the `DTB data` register.
Access must be preceded with a write of an index to the `Extra address` register.

Card ID
~~~~~~~

When more cards are present in the system, the software needs to pair
all PCIe endpoints of multi-PCIe cards to the correct parent device
(typically based on the primary PCIe endpoint with the `Endpoint ID` value 0).

For successful pairing, the firmware must announce a system-wide unique identifier of the card.
The software then reads the `Card ID` value (128b) in the `Extra data` register
and binds all PCIe endpoints with the same `Card ID` together.

The `Card ID` is valid only if the `Card ID flag` bit is set.
