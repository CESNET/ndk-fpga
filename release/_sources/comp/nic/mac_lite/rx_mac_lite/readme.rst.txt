RX MAC LITE
-----------

This component is used to implement the Ethernet MAC layer on the receiving side.
Thanks to the modular architecture (RX MAC LITE + Adapter), it can be connected to a supported ETH Hard IP block or implement the MAC layer separately.
The implementation may include differences from the Ethernet standard.

Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^

RX MAC LITE contains several components that analyze the received frame (CRC, MAC address, length) and check for errors. The Ethernet frame is stored in the buffer (store and forward), if it does not contain errors, it is sent to the output interface along with the metadata, otherwise the frame is discarded. Some of these components are optional. The whole module can be controlled by SW using MI registers (see chapter Register Map).

**Description of RX MAC LITE submodules:**

- **CTRL Unit** - controls the whole module through MI registers
- **Enabler** - enables the receiving of Ethernet frames, if disabled, incoming frames are discarded
- **CRC Cutter** - cuts the CRC of the received Ethernet frame (optional)
- **Length Check** - calculates and checks the length of the received Ethernet frame
- **CRC Check** - checks the CRC of the received Ethernet frame (optional, it is not available in OFM repository, extra license required))
- **MAC Check** - extracts and checks the MAC address of the received Ethernet frame (optional)
- **Time Stamp** - assigns a time stamp to the received Ethernet frame (optional)
- **Error masking** - allows to mask individual errors of the received Ethernet frame
- **Buffer** - store and forward buffer is used to store the received Ethernet frame
- **Stats Unit** - contains statistical counters accessible through MI registers

Adapter
^^^^^^^

The adapter allows you to connect the RX MAC LITE to various variants of the PCS/PMA layer of the Ethernet or various Ethernet Hard IPs.
The main task of the adapter is to convert the selected input bus to the MFB bus.
Currently, several variants of the adapter are implemented:

- **UMII Adapter** - connects Ethernet PCS/PMA layer with MII interface for various speeds (XGMII, XLGMII, CDGMII,...)
- **CMAC Adapter** - connects CMAC Hard IP, which is used in Xilinx UltraScale+ FPGA for 100 Gbps Ethernet (Uses MFB not LBUS!)
- **AVST Adapter** - connects E-Tile Hard IP, which is used in Intel Stratix 10 and Agilex FPGA for up to 100 Gbps Ethernet
- **MAC Segmented Adapter (WIP)** - connects F-Tile Hard IP, which is used in Intel Agilex FPGA for up to 400 Gbps Ethernet

Register Map
^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to configure RX MAC LITE on the fly, but if you want to make changes atomically, you should disable RX MAC LITE first.
You can set MAC check mode, RX MAC LITE error mask, minimal and maximal frame length.
After you are done you can enable RX MAC LITE.
You can also write all valid MAC addresses into MAC memory, but the MAC memory can be accessed by software only when the RX MAC LITE is disabled!

You can read number of received, correct, discarded and discarded due to buffer overflow frames or number of correctly received bytes.
You have to sample the counters first and then you can read their content. RX MAC LITE has four frame counters:
Total Received Frames Counter (TRFC), Correct Frames Counter (CFC), Discarded Frames Counter (DFC) and Counter of Frames Discarded due to Buffer Overflow (BODFC) and the byte counter:
Octets Received OK Counter (OROC).

.. note::

    If the RX MAC LITE unit is enabled, these counters will have a floating content.
    For this reason, it is necessary to strobe their actual values at the one moment into the counter registers.
    Software tool is then able to read those registers.

This is the low part of counter that holds number of data octets in frames that were successfully received. This does not include octets in frames received with MAC, CRC, MINTU, MTU, CRC or CGMII errors according the settings of Error mask register. This counter is incremented when a new packet is successfully received and the length of the currently received packet is added. The counted length of the packets always includes the length of CRC and vice versa.

This does not include octets in frames received with MAC, CRC, MINTU, MTU, CRC or CGMII errors according the settings of Error mask register. This counter is incremented when a new packet is successfully received and the length of the currently received packet is added.

**Memory of available MAC addresses**

This memory contains all available MAC addresses for network interface.

====  ===  =============  ======  ==============
From  To   Name           Access  Description
====  ===  =============  ======  ==============
0     47   MAC address    RW      The MAC address.
48    48   Valid bit      RW      MAC address is valid when asserted.
====  ===  =============  ======  ==============

To write the MAC address item properly you must first write low 32 bits and then high 16 bits.
If you would not do it right way the MAC have not been written.
Memory can contains up to 16 MAC addresses (it depends on MAC_COUNT generic).
Each MAC address is stored on two address positions.
The lower address contains the lower 4 bytes and the upper contains the 2 upper bytes and valid bit.
Only valid MAC addresses are used for matching.

.. warning::

    The MAC memory can be accessed by software only when the RX MAC LITE is disabled!
