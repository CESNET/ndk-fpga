AMM_PROBE
---------

.. warning::

    AMM_PROBE is now depreciated and :ref:`MEM_LOGGER<mem_logger>` should be used!


AMM_PROBE listens to the AMM bus and measures:

- Written / read AMM words and read requests count
- Number of ticks (CLK cycles) from the first to the last write request (same for read requests)
- Number of ticks (CLK cycles) of the whole communication (from the first r/w req to the last r/w req)
- Average, minimal and maximal latency of read requests
- Latency histogram of read requests
