DDR4 Memory Tester
------------------

``MEM_TESTER`` is used to test external DDR memory to detect failures and overal performance of the memory.


Key features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Memory interface is compatible with AMM (Avalon-Memory-Mapped) interface and Intel EMIF Hard IP
* Basic test workflow:

    * Sequential write of the pseudo random data to every memory address
    * Resting pseudo random generator (to generate the exactly same sequence)
    * Sequentially sending read requests to all memory address space and comparing received data with pseudo random generator output

* Additionally random address generation can be enabled to measure more realistic memory performance

    * However in this mode error counter will detect errors due to the overlap of some addresses
    * Therefore random addressing mode should be used only for measuring and not for testing

* Some other test parameters can be set:

    * Incremental read (next read request will be send only after the result of previous read is received)

        * This mode is better for measuring latencies, because memory is not loaded with other requests

    * Auto precharge for random addressing
    * Manual control over refresh period

* Test configuration can be set via MI interface
* There is also python script for generating PDF report with different modes
* Measuring is handled by :ref:`MEM_LOGGER<mem_logger>`
* ``MEM_TESTER`` must be placed to the external memory drivers clock domain

    * For MI bus there is internal MI_ASYNC component for bridging different clock domains

    * You can even manually read adn write to the external memory using :ref:`AMM_GEN<amm_gen>` component

Control SW
^^^^^^^^^^

Because the measurement is handled by `MEM_LOGGER` (`DATA_LOGGER` wrap) you need to install its package:

* You also need to install `python nfb` package

.. code-block::

    cd ofm/comp/debug/data_logger/sw
    python3 setup.py install --user


Then you can control `MEM_TESTER` using `mem_tester.py` script:

* With no arguments the script will run basic memory test and print result
* `-p` argument can be used to print `MEM_TESTER` state
* `-r` argument can be used to run test with random addressing
* If you have your card at different device than `/dev/nfb0` you can use `-d` argument
* If you have multiple `MEM_TESTER` you can select concrete instance by `-i` argument

    * This will also set the same index for `MEM_LOGGER` component

* You can even manualy write and read to the external memory using `--gen-*` arguments

.. warning::
    Test with random indexing active will generate a few errors,
    due to multiple writes to the same address.
    Its used just for measurement purpose.

Pytest SW
^^^^^^^^^

You can also use automated testing using pytest framework:

* This script will try to find `MEM_TESTER` and `MEM_LOGGER` components
* Will try to open then and read their configuration and status
* Will run sequential tests on each detected memory interface (with minimal and maximal burst counts)

.. code-block::

    python3 -m pytest -xs --tb=short test_mem_tester.py
    # -s ... to show measured data
    # -x ... end after first failure
    # -tb ... show only assertion message

If you need to use different device, edit `device` variable in test_mem_tester.py

PDF report generator SW
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Additionally you can run `report_gen.py` script that will run `MEM_TESTER` with different configurations
and will generate PDF or Markdown report with measured graphs.

* The report will contain basic configuration of the `MEM_TESTER` and `MEM_LOGGER`.
* Result of the full memory test on each interface including table with measured latencies, data flow, ...
* Number of tests on the smaller memory address space that will try different burst counts (data lengths)

In order to generate PDF report you need to install `pandoc` and `texlive` or other LATEX engine:

* If you don't need PDF report you can run `report_gen.py` with `md` argument (only Markdown and graphs will be generated)

.. code-block::

    sudo yum install pandoc
    sudo yum install texlive-latex
    sudo yum install texlive

Then you can generate PDF or (only Markdown) report using:

.. code-block::

    python3 report_gen.py
    python3 report_gen.py md


This script will generate following files:

* Markdown and PDF report: ``mem_tester_report.md``, ``mem_tester_report.pdf``
* Graphs in ``fig/*`` folder
* Raw JSON data in ``data.json`` file


Internal Architecture
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Architecture description:

* :ref:`MI bus<mi_bus>` logic is separated into another file (``mem_tester_mi.vhd``)

    * :ref:`MI_ASYNC <mi_async>` is used to cross between MI bus and Avalon clock domains
    * :ref:`MI_SPLITTER_PLUS_GEN <mi_splitter_plus_gen>` divides MI bus for mem_tester and AMM_GEN components

* :ref:`AMM_GEN <amm_gen>` can be used to manually access the external memory
* ``LFSR_SIMPLE_RANDOM_GEN`` components generate random data and addresses for testing external memory
* ``AMM_MUX`` is used to select between these AMM interfaces:

    * Internal logic during memory test
    * :ref:`AMM_GEN <amm_gen>` during the manual access

* The whole component is then controlled by FSM

MI Bus Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**MI Address Space Definition**

.. code-block::

    0x0000 -- ctrl in
              1. bit -- reset
              2. bit -- reset EMIF IP
              3. bit -- run test
              4. bit -- AMM_GEN enable (connects AMM_GEN to AMM bus)
              5. bit -- random addressing enable
              6. bit -- max. one simultaneous read transaction (for measuring latency)
              7. bit -- auto precharge request to EMIF (if connected)
    0x0004 -- ctrl out
              1. bit -- test done
              2. bit -- test successful
              3. bit -- ECC error occurred
              4. bit -- calibration success
              5. bit -- calibration fail
              6. bit -- AMM_READY
    0x0008 -- err cnt
    0x000C -- burst cnt during test
    0x0010 -- limit address during test
    0x0014 -- refresh period
    0x0018 -- default refresh period
    0x0040 -- AMM_GEN   base address


Following bits inside ``ctrl in`` register reacts only for rising edge:

* ``reset`` bit
* ``reset EMIF IP`` bit
* ``run test`` bit

**Usage**

Reset sequence:

* Set ``reset`` bit to ``1`` and then to ``0``
* To reset EMIF IP set ``reset EMIF IP`` bit to ``1`` and then to ``0`` and
  wait for either ``calibration successful`` bit or ``calibration fail`` bit

Run test:

* To run the test set ``run test`` bit to ``1``
* After the test is finished ``test done`` bit will be set to ``1`` and the result will be available in ``test successful`` bit
* Error count during test will be available inside err cnt register
