Configuration files and parameters
**********************************
This chapter describes the NDK configuration files and parameters. The
configuration has three levels: the CORE, the card, and the user application. A
detailed description of each level is below (the abreviated version is provided
via the :ref:`following link <ndk_conf_tldr>`).

.. _ndk_build_files:

Build system files
==================

The following table provides an overview of files used for building a project/design.

.. note::
    Path ``build/card`` reduced to build, ``ndk/core/intel`` reduced to ``core``, ``ndk/cards/vendor/dev`` reduced to card.
    The placeholder {TOOL} refers to the tool-specific filename, for example: Vivado, Quartus.

.. _ndk_core_configuration:

Parametrizing NDK-CORE design
=============================
The files in the ``<NDK-CORE_root_directory>/intel/config`` directory and the
``<NDK-CORE_root_directory>/intel/core.mk`` file contain CORE parameters. Some
of these parameters are configurable (more info below). The sourcing of
configuration parameter files has its own hierarchy, which is shown in the
:ref:`fig_const_hierarchy`. This section describes the
configuration files used in the case of NDK-CORE design. For the description of
the application and card-specific configuration, see following sections on this page.

.. _fig_const_hierarchy:

    :align: center

    Hierarchy diagram

    Numbers show the order in which these parameter files are sourced. Sourcing
    takes place in the `core_boostrap.tcl` file.

File description
-----------------

.. _ndk_core_conf_core_conf_tcl:

core_conf.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file provides a listing of all parameters that can be changed by the user.
Each parameter contains a comment with allowed values and the meaning of
these values. Because the NDK-CORE design is independent of the underlying
platform (e.g. card type) there are many allowed combinations of parameters.
However, the user can find many combinations of parameters that are unsupported
and may cause errors during the synthesis/implementation process. The user can add
other configuration parameters to this file according to their need.

.. _ndk_core_conf_core_const_tcl:

core_const.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. WARNING::
    This file contains parameters that should not be changed deliberately by the
    user. They are for development purposes only.

The first purpose of this file is to pass the values of specific parameters to
the VHDL package which is included as a part of the FPGA design. Parameters
specified in the ``core_conf.tcl`` are visible in this file and so are the
parameters specific for the chosen card type. Passing TCL parameters to VHDL
constants is a specific use case described in the :ref:`core_config_vhdl_pkg_const`
section below.

The second purpose of this file is when the value of a parameter
depends on the value of another NDK CORE constant.
Conditionally assigned parameters that are for a specific
card type should be located in a corresponding :ref:`card_conf_card_const_tcl`
file. An example of a conditional assignment follows:

.. code-block:: tcl

    set PCIE_LANES 16

    # setting the number of PCIE_LANES to 8 when specific PCIe configuration is used
    if {$PCIE_ENDPOINTS == 1 && $PCIE_ENDPOINT_MODE == 2} {
        set PCIE_LANES 8
    }

The third purpose of this file is to implement statements that check compatible
combinations of parameters. When an incompatible combination is detected, the
TCL shell will raise an error and stop the compilation process. You should
implement these checks only for the parameters used in the NDK-CORE.

.. _core_mk_include:

core.mk
^^^^^^^
This file contains default values for the parameters specified in the Makefile.
The allowed values of each parameter are provided in the comments. The user of the
design can change these values freely.

core_bootstrap.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. WARNING::
   The features in this file are for development and should not be changed.

This file loads all necessary path variables from the environment. Then are
sourced all configuration files described in the :ref:`fig_const_hierarchy`. The
files with the lowest priority are sourced first and the ones with the highest
priority last. The ``core_const.tcl`` file has the highest priority.

Further work with parameters
----------------------------
.. WARNING::
   These features are for development and should not be used in regular
   application use.

Developing a new design often requires working with configuration
parameters during compilation/synthesis of the VHDL source files. For this purpose,
there are two mechanisms provided for passing the parameters specified in the
TCL shell to affect the final VHDL design.

Passing through Modules.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As described in the :ref:`ofm_build_system` section, the Modules.tcl files allow
for modular and hierarchical organization of VHDL source files. The Modules.tcl files
provide an *ARCHGRP* list to pass specific constants across the source file hierarchy. Each
Modules.tcl file obtains such a list from its parent Modules.tcl file. It allows further
adjustments of the ARCHGRP list(s) of its descendant(s).

The parameters specified in the NDK-CORE repository are passed using the
``CORE_ARCHGRP`` associative array. The array is initialized in the
``<NDK-CORE_root_directory>/intel/common.inc.tcl`` file. Parameters are specified in
the ``core_conf.tcl`` and ``core_const.tcl`` files. This means that the configuration
parameters of a chosen card are visible in this file and can be added to the
array. The associative array was chosen for clarity purposes. Because the
ARCHGRP is declared as a simple list, the associative array is converted to it
and added to the ``FPGA`` entity. As the ARCHGRP list is passed through
the hierarchy, it is converted back
to the associative array when a specific array value is needed. An example is shown in the
``<NDK-CORE_root_directory>/intel/Modules.tcl`` file.

.. _core_config_vhdl_pkg_const:

Adding constants to the VHDL package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A dynamic VHDL package is generated each time a user starts
building a new design. The package is called ``combo_user_const`` and
contains all parameters which were added in the ``core_const.tcl`` file described
previously. The values are passed to the VHDL package with specific types using
TCL procedures in the VhdlPkgGen.tcl script. This script can be found in the build folder
in the OFM repository (:ref:`ofm_build_system`). Examples of some procedures are
provided in the following code block:

.. code-block:: tcl

    # passing TCL parameters
    VhdlPkgString FANCY_STRING $FANCY_STRING

    VhdlPkgInt SOME_INTEGER $SOME_INTEGER

    VhdlPkgBool SOME_BOOLEAN $SOME_BOOLEAN

    # passing specific values
    VhdlPkgBool IMPORTANT_BOOLEAN true

    VhdlPkgHexVector LARGE_VECTOR 64 ABCDEF0123456789

.. NOTE::
   It is recommended to pass TCL parameters to the VHDL package with the same
   name.

.. _ndk_card_configuration:

Parametrizing a specific card type
==================================
The final design of the NDK application depends on the underlying
platform, e.g., the card type on which the design should run.
The system provides mechanism to configure card specific parameters.

File description
----------------
The file structure is similar to the one described in the configuration of the
`NDK-CORE` design.

card_conf.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file lists user-configurable parameters and their possible values in the
comments. The file contains parameters relevant to a specific card. Those
parameters are mostly tied to the underlying hardware, like the number of Ethernet
ports or the PCIe generation of the used PCIe core. The purpose of this file is the
same as that of the ``core_conf.tcl`` file in the `NDK-CORE` repository. The only
difference is that it has a higher priority.

.. _card_conf_card_const_tcl:

card_const.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. WARNING::
   This file contains features for development. It is not recommended for the user to change
   the parameters in this file.

To ensure that the values of the configuration parameters are valid and
compatible with the values of other parameters, they need to be checked. And
that is done here, making this file similar to the `core_const.tcl`. The only
difference is that the checking considers only the used card. For example, if
the given card supports two QSFP transceivers at most, the corresponding
parameter should be set to either 1 or 2.

It is also possible to add a constant for a specific card to the VHDL package.
This package is also included in the `fpga.vhd` top-level component (this
component is card-specific too).

The third way is to add conditionally assigned parameters, which is the same way
they are used in the `core_const.tcl` file.

card.mk
^^^^^^^
.. WARNING::
   This file contains features for development. It is not recommended for the user to change
   the parameters in this file.

This part of the Makefile sources all environment variables used
during the initial stage of the build process. The majority of the variables contain
paths to various locations from which the design is sourced/built. There are also
build-specific variables that further parametrize the design. The purpose of
these is described in the :ref:`app_config_makefile` section.

Further work with parameters
----------------------------
.. WARNING::
   These features are for development and should not be used in regular
   application use.

Passing the parameter values to other parts of the design or build system is
very similar to the case of `NDK-CORE`.

Passing through Modules.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The card-specific parameters are passed to the Modules.tcl file of the top-level
entity using the ``CARD_ARCHGRP`` associative array. This array is initialized in
the ``<card_root_directory>/src/Vivado.inc.tcl`` file for Xilinx-based cards and
in ``<card_root_directory>/src/Quartus.inc.tcl`` for Intel-based cards. The
``CARD_ARCHGRP`` array is concatenated with ``CORE_ARCHGRP`` so the top-level
Modules.tcl file shares parameters of them both. The parameters specified
in the :ref:`ndk_core_conf_core_conf_tcl`, :ref:`ndk_core_conf_core_const_tcl`,
`card_conf.tcl`, `card_const.tcl` and also :ref:`ndk_app_conf_app_conf_tcl`.
are visible in the `*.inc.tcl` files and can be added to the array.

Adding constants to the VHDL package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is recommended to add card-specific constants to the ``combo_user_const`` VHDL
package in `card_const.tcl` file. The way of adding these constants was described in 
the :ref:`core_config_vhdl_pkg_const` section in the documentation of NDK-CORE
configuration.

.. _ndk_app_configuration:

Parametrizing the user application
==================================
The user application can also be parametrized using specific configuration
files. Configuration parameters can be handed to the subcomponents of the
``APPLICATION_CORE`` design entity. It also allows the user to choose one of,
sometimes, multiple configurations for a specific card before launching the
build process.

Configuration files
-------------------
The configuration of the application is less constrained than `NDK-CORE` and
card configuration. The application repository provides three files in which the user
application is or can be configured.

.. _app_config_makefile:

build/<card_name>/Makefile
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. WARNING::
   This file contains features for development. It is not recommended for the user to change
   the parameters in this file.


This is the top-level file that launches the building of the design. The
configuration(s) given in this file depend on the card type and they allow to build the
design with different parameters, for example, when there are multiple Ethernet configurations.
For more information about the modes of each
card, visit the "Build instructions" section provided in the documentation for each of the
card types.

The configuration parameters are handed as environment variables which are
converted into TCL variables. These are used in the `*_const.tcl*` and
`*_conf.tcl` files throughout the design. There are more Makefile configuration
parameters in use than just Ethernet configuration. They are declared in the
:ref:`core_mk_include` and can be changed when issuing the ``make`` command.
The example of this goes as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    # default build configuration
    make DMA_TYPE=4

    # choosing to build specific Ethernet configuration
    make 100g4 DMA_TYPE=3

build/<card_name>/{Vivado,Quartus}.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file adds the ``APPLICATION_CORE`` architecture where a logic of a
user application is. The `APP_ARCHGRP` associative array is
initialized in this file and allows the user to pass one or more user-specified
parameter(s) to Modules.tcl files of the ``APPLICATION_CORE`` and its underlying
components. All configuration parameters in the :ref:`fig_const_hierarchy`
are visible here and can be added to the array as well.

.. _ndk_app_conf_app_conf_tcl:

build/<card_name>/app_conf.tcl
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file has the highest priority of all user-configurable
constants (for more details, refer to the :ref:`fig_const_hierarchy`). The user
can change the parameters specified in this file or add others according to
their needs. Adding a parameter to the VHDL package is also possible because the
`combo_user_const` is also included in the `APPLICATION_CORE` entity.

.. _ndk_conf_tldr:

TL;DR
=====
This section contains specific recipes for achieving specific goals.

I need to include specific component in CORE depending on a given parameter value
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. First, you should write your parameter to the
   ``core/intel/config/core_conf.tcl`` with a specific value (if the parameter
   stays only in the ``core/intel/config/core_conf.tcl``) or with a default
   value (if the parameter will be set in other configuration files).
2. Then add this parameter to the *CORE_ARCHGRP* array in the
   ``core/intel/common.inc.tcl`` file.

.. code-block:: tcl

    set CORE_ARCHGRP(DMA_TYPE)                      $DMA_TYPE
    set CORE_ARCHGRP(APPLICATION_CORE_ENTITY_ONLY)  false
    # adding two custom parameters
    set CODE_ARCHGRP(MY_PARAM_1)                    $MY_PARAM_1
    set CODE_ARCHGRP(MY_PARAM_2)                    $MY_PARAM_2

.. NOTE::
   The name of the constant added to the array should be the same as the name of
   the parameter, thus ``set CORE_ARCHGRP(MY_PARAM) $MY_PARAM``.

3. The build system then converts the array to a list which is propagated as ``ARCHGRP`` through the
   ``Modules.tcl`` file of the ``fpga.vhd`` component to the ``Modules.tcl`` of
   the ``fpga_common.vhd``.

.. NOTE::
   Notice that the ``fpga.vhd`` component is dependent on a specific card but already contains
   all propagated parameters of the CORE design.

4. The ``ARCHGRP`` can be propagated to other subcomponents when added as the
   third element of a subcomponent list. This is shown in the following snippet.

.. code-block:: tcl

    lappend COMPONENTS [list "<entity_name_1>" "<path_to_entity_1>" $ARCHGRP]
    # "FULL" is the default value for the ARCHGRP field
    lappend COMPONENTS [list "<entity_name_2>" "<path_to_entity_2>" "FULL"  ]

5. When a constant from the ``ARCHGRP`` is needed, the list has to be
   converted back to an array:

.. code-block:: tcl

    array set ARCHGRP_ARR $ARCHGRP

6. The values from the ``ARCHGRP_ARR`` can then be accessed in a similar way in
   which they were added to the array.

.. code-block:: tcl

    if { $ARCHGRP_ARR(MY_PARAM_1) == 3 } {
        # do one thing
    } elseif { $ARCHGRP_ARR(MY_PARAM_1) == 4 } {
        # do other thing
    }

What can I do with the `core_conf.tcl` file
-------------------------------------------
* You can declare new configuration parameters (and assign their default
  values) so they would be visible across all supported cards. These default
  values can be overwritten in the `card_conf.tcl` file of each card.
* Write allowed values of parameters to the commentary above each declaration.
  Especially when new configuration parameter or parameter value is added.

What can I do with the `core_const.tcl` file
--------------------------------------------
* You can add a dependent parameter (the value of such a parameter depends on
  the value of another parameter). The developer should add CORE-specific
  parameters only. (Those are the ones that are common across all supported
  cards.)

.. code-block:: tcl

    if {$PCIE_ENDPOINTS == 1 && $PCIE_ENDPOINT_MODE == 2} {
        set MY_PARAM_2 8
    } else {
        set MY_PARAM_2 16
    }

* You can check combinations of different parameters. This allows you to avoid various
  incompatibilities which may (or may not) crash the synthesis. An unsuccessful check
  stops the compilation process.

.. code-block:: tcl

    if { $MY_PARAM_1 != 3 && $MY_PARAM_1 != 4 } {
        error "Unsupported value of MY_PARAM_1: $MY_PARAM_1!"
    }

* You can add a parameter value to the generated VHDL package, which is then icluded in
  the `fpga.vhd` and `fpga_common.vhd` components:

.. code-block:: tcl

    VhdlPkgInt  PCIE_GEN             $PCIE_GEN
    VhdlPkgInt  DMA_TYPE             $DMA_TYPE
    VhdlPkgBool DMA_RX_BLOCKING_MODE $DMA_RX_BLOCKING_MODE
    VhdlPkgInt  MY_PARAM_1           $MY_PARAM_1

What can I do with the `card_conf.tcl` file
-------------------------------------------
You can change parameters specified in the `core_conf.tcl` file for a specific
card type (because some parameters are directly dependent on an underlying
hardware), e.g., the number of Ethernet ports or Ethernet channels.

What can I do with the `card_const.tcl` file
--------------------------------------------
* You can add a dependent parameter when a card requiers it. CORE specific
  parameters belong to the `core_const.tcl`.
* You can check the parameter values to see if they adhere to the selected card.
* You can add a parameter to the VHDL package which will be used in the card's
  `fpga.vhd` top-level component.

What can I do with the `app_conf.tcl` file
------------------------------------------
* You can add parameters for the given application (component
  `application_core.vhd`).
* You can change parameters specified in the `core_conf.tcl` and `card_conf.tcl`
  files with respect to the application.
* You can add a parameter to the VHDL package, which is used in the
  `application_core.vhd` component (the same package as in the `card_const.tcl`
  and `core_const.tcl`).
